## Recap of tests

Cypress was rather simple and easy to understand. Took me some time though to
notice that Cypress runs in a smaller resolution than 1920x1080 but that was
an easy fix. It's clear that eesti.ee has tests written for it by the
developers already (HTML tags are custom) and that made the testing easier
for me as well.
